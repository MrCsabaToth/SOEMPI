<h1>Generate Salts</h1>
<p>All Bloom Filter generation will need salts. Salts are stored by the Key Server
(in some cases Parameter Manager also acts as the Key Server). All other components
will use the Key Server's service to obtain the salts, so everyone would use the same set.</p>
<p>Please consult the specific <a href="configure_keyserver_settings.html">instructions</a>
on how to change Key Server and salt settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please log in to the Key Server's SOEMPI instance.
Make sure you select Key Server component type, and incheck Expert Mode checkbox. Click on the Login button:

<li>Click on Salt Management toolbar button:<br/>

<li>Click on the Generate Salts button:<br/>

<li>If everything went ok, you'll see positive feedback:<br/>

<li>You may encounter negative feedback:<br/>

This error may occur the first time you try to add a salt.
SOEMPI is under development and the user management section is not completed yet. For some reason
sometimes SOEMPI cannot fill in the <tt>userCreatedBy</tt> property of the salt entity.
That is a non-null column in the database, so this will generate an error. You'll see that the next
add salt attempts will be successful. One workoaround for the problem could be to try to
Add a (dummy) Key entity first before you would try to add a Salt entity. If you see a Failure message
click on the button again.<br/>
The error's result is that the Key entities
won't start at the id you configured at the other components. Either you
have to reconfigure the salt related settings in all SOEMPI components,
or you would have to resolve the error manually in the database. If you try to curate the
error in the database by hand, be aware that every generated salt has a corresponding audit
entry in the database. So if you want to change any salt's id, you have to delete the
corresponding audit id too.
