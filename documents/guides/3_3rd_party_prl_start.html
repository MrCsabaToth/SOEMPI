<h1>Multi-party privacy preserving record linkage, 3 3rd parties</h1>
You supposedly setup and configured every participant and imported the two datasets to the two data providers.
A wizard is accessible at the Data Providers which guide through the configuration steps.
<ol>
<li>First please <a href="soempi_user_login.html">log in</a> to the data provider if you haven't done so.<br/>
	<img src="img/DataProviderLogin.jpg" />
</li>
<li>Click on the Record Linkage Wizard toolbar button or activate it from the menu.<br/>
	<img src="img/PRLWizardStart.jpg" />
</li>
<li>You will be presented the Blocking Configuration page. The blocking fields are not used right now.
For the Data Provider the important setting here is the "number of pairs to sample",
that's how many pairs it will sampled randomly for the measurements at the Parameter Manager.
Click on the Next button.<br/>
	<img src="img/PRL3WizardBlockingConfig.jpg" />
</li>
<li>You'll see the Matching Fields Configuration page.
Right now SOEMPI deducts the matching fields from that configuration. The salted SHA encoded versions of the fields
are either already available or will be generated on-the-fly during the send process later.
Right now the Data Provider send all records to the Data Integrator so it'll generate all record pairs
from the two received samples, there's no blocking.<br/>
	<img src="img/PRLWizardMatchingFieldsConfig.jpg" />
</li>
<li>You'll see the Matching Parameters Configuration page, where you can configure the EM specific settings.
The Data Integrator and Parameter Manager doesn't take these detailed values from the Data Providers. So you have to make
certain settings right there before the process. Click on the Next button.<br/>
	<img src="img/PRLWizardMatchingParametersConfig.jpg" />
</li>
<li>Please input the following:
<ul>
<li>Select the desired dataset you want to start with by the leading checkbox of the row</li>
<li>Unique match name (this is the unique name for the PRL itself, and the other DP should specify the same value,
that's how requests are paired with each other)</li>
<li>Unique table name (the table will be created at Parameter Manager (in case of 3 3rd party,
Data Integrator in case of 2 3rd protocol) by this name)</li>
<li>Select the desired PRL protocol method (simple, 2 3rd party, 3 3rd party setups)</li>
</ul>
Press the Send button to start the procedure:<br/>
	<img src="img/PRL3Start.jpg" />
</li>
<li>Next a dialog will pop-up where you can specify credentials for the Key Server, Parameter Manager,
and the Data Integrator. Let's leave the default values in the Login dialog for the sake of the argument of this guide.<br/>

</li>
<li>The procedure starts:<br/>
	<img src="img/PRL3Wait1.jpg" /><br/>
	<img src="img/PRL3Wait2.jpg" /><br/>
Currently the AJAX wait icon is a little covered.
</li>
<li>When the procedure finishes, the Waiting ribbon and icon disappears.<br/>

</li>
</ol>

The following things happened in the background (TODO screenshot DB changes):
<ol>

<li>
Data Provider beginning:
<ol>
<li>DP authenticates itself towards PM with the appropriate credentials entered in the PRL Login screen.</li>
<li>DP sends randomly sampled subset of the subject dataset, and only the salted SHA encoded matching fields to the PM.</li>
<li>Finally DP sends a <tt>PersonMatchRequest</tt> object, which specifies the unique match codename (so they can be paired), the table name, etc.
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Calculations at PM:
<ol>
<li>PM accepts PersonMatchRequests. Every time it receives one tries to look up a matching one in the database by the match name.
If a matching one found the computation begins.</li>
<li>PM looks at the two random sampled salted SHA encoded datasets, and check if the parameters match.</li>
<li>PM generates all possible record pairs from the datasets and performs an EM calculation and
record linkage (exact matching can be performed only because of the SHA transformation's non distance preserving capability).</li>
<li>As a result of the EM, PM calculates <tt>BloomFilterParameterAdvice</tt> object for the parties.</li>
<li>The DPs periodically poll the PM if the computation is over and eventually will receive the advice about BF sizes
from PM.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Calculations at DPs:
<ol>
<li>DPs bloom filter re-encode the involved fields of their previously imported dataset according to PM's
advice and persist that in a separate dataset.</li>
<li>DP authenticates itself to the DI with the appropriate credentials entered in the PRL Login screen.</li>
<li>DP sends the whole re-encoded BF dataset to DI.</li>
<li>Finally DP sends a <tt>PersonMatchRequest</tt> object, which specifies the unique matching codename
(again for pairing) and the table name, etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Calculations at DI
<ol>
<li>DI accepts PersonMatchRequests. Every time it receives one tries to look up a matching one in the database.
If a matching one found the computation begins.</li>
<li>DI generates all possible record pairs from the datasets and performs an EM calculation and
record linkage (using DiceBinary comparisons and scaled weight scoring method).</li>
<li>DI persist the linkage results.</li>
</ol>
</li>
