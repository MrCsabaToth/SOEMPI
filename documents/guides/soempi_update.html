<h1>Updating SOEMPI source</h1>
Your source code should be already checked out if you want to update.
<ol>
	<li>Open up a command prompt</li>
	<li>Go to the SOEMPI source root (Linux (example): "<tt>cd /home/username/SOEMPI/</tt>",
	Windows (example): "<tt>cd C:\SOEMPI\openempi</tt>")</li>
	<li>Say "<tt>svn update</tt>"</li>
</ol>
Because you had a version of the source, the SVN client could read any necessary meta data
(like repository URL) and perform the operation without any extra parameters.<p/>
If you modified something in the source code, please make sure that you don't have any conflicts
after the update. If you have any conflicts, you have to resolve it manually.<p/>
After source update, refresh your root project in your Eclipse, which will induce a compilation
of Eclipse's own compiled version. Also build the soure code from command line and deploy it to JBoss.
